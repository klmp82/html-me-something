                    <p> I've been cooking at home for a huge part of my life. From a young age I always had the dream to go to culinary school
                        I finally followed that dream and enrolled in culinary school at the Natural Gourmet Institute in New York City. The program
                        was 11 months and my first day of this new chapter was September 1st, 2015.

                    <p> Although I knew alot coming in to school there was so much more I didn't know. Learning professional culinary terms and
                        techniques was the focus of the first few weeks of class, before we got to actually move to the kitchens. This was
                        great because it gave me a foundation to work from as I perfected my culinary skills.

                    <p> There were a lot of bumps and bruises (literally) along the way. But a couple months into the program I started to get
                        the hang of the whole cooking in a professional kitchen thing. I became more confident in my skills and manuevering
                        in the kitchen.

                    <p> This is the day we had been working towards. Friday Night Dinner was the equivalent to our final project. As a group
                        we had to create a menu, calculate all food costs, prep and cook a 3 course meal for 100 guests. Our theme was
                        "Southeast Asian".

                    <p> The program went by super fast, and before I knew it graduation day had come. This day was bittersweet because my classmates
                        and I had become like a family. We didn't want to separate, but we also knew we each had exciting things in store for our
                        future.

                    <p> My last night in NYC with the people who I had grown so close to. I couldn't have asked for a better group of people to
                        spend it with. The year spent in NYC was the fastest year of my life but also the most rewarding and one I will always
                        cherish.
